# Files-Transfer-App
This app allows you to transfer files over local network. All you need is to install app instances on sending and receiving devices. If firewalls of those devices do not block network traffic produced by this app devices should detect each other automatically. Then you choose machine you want to send file to, select file to be transferred and wait for acceptance from receiving side. 
Notice: this very simple program written by a beginner, probably with many bugs, no data encryption is used so you should treat this app as a toy and use only in your private local network.
